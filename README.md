# README Generator

## Description
A command-line application that generates a high-quality, professional README file for any project. It prompts the user for information about their application repository and creates a README with predefined sections. When command line is prompted, a series of questions will be displayed, all for user input, except for on multiple choice question asking for which license. Once all questions have been answered, a well structured README file will appear, with all the proper sections, from title, description, table of contents, installation, and more.
